## 13.3 Insertion

### 13.3-1
***
In line 16 of RB-INSERT, we set the color of the newly inserted node z to red. Observe that if we had chosen to set z's color to black, 
then property 4 of a red-black tree would not be violated. Why didnâ€™t we choose to set z's color to black?

### `Solution:`
Violate property 5.

### 13.3-2
***
Show the red-black trees that result after successively inserting the keys 41, 38, 31, 12, 19, 8 into an initially empty red-black tree.

### `Solution:`
Insert 41:

### 13.3-3
***
Suppose that the black-height of each of the subtrees alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon in Figures 13.5 and 13.6 is k. Label each node 
in each figure with its black-height to verify that the indicated transformation preserves property 5.

### 13.3-4
***
Professor Teach is concerned that RB-INSERT-FIXUP might set T.nil.color to RED, in which case the test in line 1 would not cause the 
loop to terminate when z is the root. Show that the professor's concern is unfounded by arguing that RBINSERT-FIXUP never sets 
T.nil.color to RED.

### `Solution:`
In order to set T.nil.color to RED, z.p must be the root; and if z.p is the root, then z.p is black, the loop terminates. 

### 13.3-5
***
Consider a red-black tree formed by inserting n nodes with RB-INSERT. Argue that if n > 1, the tree has at least one red node.

### `Solution:`
Obvious.

### 13.3-6
***
Suggest how to implement RB-INSERT efficiently if the representation for red-black trees includes no storage for parent pointers.
