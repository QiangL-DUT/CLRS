## 11.3 Hash functions

### 11.3-1
***
Suppose we wish to search a linked list of length n, where each element contains a key k along with a hash value h(k). Each key is a 
long character string. How might we take advantage of the hash values when searching the list for an element with a given key?

### `Solution:`
Compare the long character strings only when they have the same hash values.

### 11.3-2
***
Suppose that we hash a string of r characters into m slots by treating it as a radix-128 number and then using the division method. 
We can easily represent the number m as a 32-bit computer word, but the string of r characters, treated as a radix-128 number, takes 
many words. How can we apply the division method to compute the hash value of the character string without using more than a constant 
number of words of storage outside the string itself?

### `Solution:`
    DIVISION(s, m)
        sum = 0
        for i = 1 to r
            sum = (sum * 128 + s[i]) % m
        return sum

### 11.3-3
***
Consider a version of the division method in which h(k) = k mod m, where m = 2^p - 1 and k is a character string interpreted in 
radix 2^p. Show that if we can derive string x from string y by permuting its characters, then x and y hash to the same value. Give 
an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.

### `Solution:`
2^p mod (2^p-1) = 1

(c * (2^p)^x) mod (2^p-1) = c * 1^x = c

Thus the hashing is equivalent to (sum c_i) mod m, the strings with different permutations will have the same hashing value.

### 11.3-4
***
Consider a hash table of size m = 1000 and a corresponding hash function h(k) = \lfloor m (kA mod 1) \rfloor for A = (sqrt{5}-1)/2. 
Compute the locations to which the keys 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65 are mapped.

### *11.3-5
***
Define a family $$\mathcal{H}$$ of hash functions from a finite set U to a finite set B to be __*$$\epsilon$$-universal*__ 
if for all pairs of distinct elements k and l in U,

Pr{h(k)==h(l)} <= epsilon,

where the probability is over the choice of the hash function h drawn at random from the family $$\mathcal{H}$$. Show that an 
epsilon-universal family of hash functions must have

epsilon >= 1/|B| - 1/|U|.

### *11.3-6
***
Let U be the set of n-tuples of values drawn from $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$, and let $$B=\mathbb{Z}_p$$, where p is prime. Define the hash 
function h_b: U \rightarrow B$$ for $$b \in \mathbb{Z}_p$$ on an input $$n$$-tuple $$\langle a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1} \rangle$$ from U
as

$$\displaystyle h_b(\langle a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1} \rangle)=\left ( \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}a_jb^j \right ) ~\text{mod}~p$$,

and let $$\mathcal{H}=\{ h_b : b \in \mathbb{Z}_p \}$$. Argue that $$\mathcal{H}$$ is $$((n-1)/p)$$-universal according to the definition of $$\epsilon$$-universal in Exercise 11.3-5.
