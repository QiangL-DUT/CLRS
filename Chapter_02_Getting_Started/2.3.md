### `Solution: `
* A = [3, 41, 26, 52, 38, 57, 9, 49]
* A = [3, 26, 41, 52, 9, 38, 49, 57]
* A = [3, 9, 26, 38, 41, 49, 52, 57]

### Exercises 2.3-2
***
Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying the remainder of the other array back into A.

### `Solution: `
        MERGE(A, p, q, r)
                n1 = q - p + 1
                n2 = r - q
                let L[1..n1] and R[1..n2] be new arrays
                for i = 1 to n1
                        L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
                for j = 1 to n2
                        R[j] = A[q + j]
                i = 1
                j = 1
                k = p;
                while i <= n1 && j <=n2
                        if L[i] <= R[j]
                                A[k] = L[i]
                                i = i + 1
                        else
                                A[k] = R[j]
                                j = j + 1
                        k = k + 1
                while i <= n1
                        A[k] = L[i]
                        i = i + 1
                        k = k + 1
                while j <= n2
                        A[k] = R[j]
                        j = j + 1
                        k = k +1

### Exercises 2.3-3
***
Use mathematical induction to show that when n is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrence $$T(n)=\left{\begin{matrix}2 & \text{if}\; n = 2 \ 2T(n/2)+n & \text{if}\; n = 2^k, \text{for}\; k>1\end{matrix}\right.$$ is $$T(n)=n\lg n$$.

*** `Solution:`
* T(2) = 2 = 2lg2
* Assume that T(2^k) = 2^k * lg(2^k), then T(2^(k+1)) = 2 * T(2^(k+1) / 2) + 2^(k+1) = 2 * 2^k * lg(2^k) +  2^(k+1) = 2^(k+1) * (lg(2^k)+1) = 2^(k+1) * lg(2^(k+1)). So it proved.

### Exercises 2.3-4
***
Insertion sort can be expressed as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort A[1..n], we recursively sort A[1..n -1] and then insert A[n] into the sorted array A[1..n - 1]. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.

### `Solution: `
                T(n) = Θ(1), if n == 1
                T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(n-1), otherwise
where Θ(n) is the time to insert an element in a sorted array of n elements.

### Exercises 2.3-5
***
Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence A is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against v and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. **Binary search** is an algorithm that repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is Θ(lg n).
### `Answer`
        BINART-SEARCH(A, v)
                low = 1
                high = A.length
                while low <= high
                        mid = (low + high) / 2
                        if A[mid] == v
                                return mid
                        if A[mid] < v
                                low = mid + 1
                        else
                                high = mid - 1
                return NIL

### Exercises 2.3-6
***
Observe that the while loop of lines 5 - 7 of the **INSERTION-SORT** procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray A[1..j - 1]. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to Θ(n lg n)?

### `Solution: `
No, the search time is Θ(lgn), but the time of moving elements is still Θ(n) in each iteration.

### Exercises 2.3-7
***
Describe a Θ(n lg n)-time algorithm that, given a set S of n integers and another integer x,
determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.

### `Solution: `
        PAIR-EXIST(S, x)
                MERGE-SORT(S, 1, S.length)         
                //nondecreasing
                l = 1
                r = A.length
                while l < r
                        if (S[l] + S[r]) == x
                                return true
                        else if (S[l] + S[r]) < x
                                l = l + 1
                        else
                                r = r - 1
                return false
