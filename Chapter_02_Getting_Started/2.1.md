## 2.1 Insertion sort

### 2.1-1

> Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array $$A = \left \langle 31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58 \right \rangle$$.


### 2.1-2

> Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

### `Solution:`

	Insertion_Sort(nonincreasing):
		for j = 2 to A.length
   			key = A[j]
     			i = j-1
     			while i > 0 and A[i] < key
       				A[i+1] = A[i]
       				i = i -1
     			A[i+1] = key

	DYNAMIC_ACTIVITY_SELECTOR(S):
		initialize c[i,j] = 0
		for i <- 1 to n
			do for j <- 2 to n
				do if i >= j
					then c[i,j] <- 0
				else
					for k <- i+1 to j-1
						do if c[i,j] < c[i,k] + c[k,j] + 1
							then c[i,j] <- c[i,k] + c[k,j] + 1
								s[i,j] <- k
								
								
### 2.1-3

> Consider the __searching problem__:
>
> __Input__: A sequence of $$n$$ numbers $$A = \left \langle a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n\right \rangle$$ and a value $$v$$.
>
> __Output__: An index $$i$$ such that $$v=A[i]$$ or the special value NIL if $$v$$ does not appear in A.
>
> Write pseudocode for __linear search__, which scans through the sequence, looking for $$v$$. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

### 2.1-4

> Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays $$A$$ and $$B$$. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an $$(n+1)$$-element array $$C$$. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.
