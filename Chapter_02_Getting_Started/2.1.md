## 2.1 Insertion sort

### 2.1-1
***
Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array A = [31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58].

### 2.1-2

> Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

### `Solution:`
	Insertion_Sort(A):                 %% nonincreasing
		for j = 2 to A.length
   			key = A[j]
     			i = j-1
     			while i > 0 and A[i] < key
       				A[i+1] = A[i]
       				i = i -1
     			A[i+1] = key
     			
### 2.1-3

Consider the searching problem:

* **Input**: A sequence of n numbers A = [a1, a2, . . . , an] and a value v.
* **Output**: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for **linear search**, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

### 2.1-4
***
Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n + 1)-element array C. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.
