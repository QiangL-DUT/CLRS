## 6.4 The heapsort algorithm

### 6.4-1
***
Using Figure 6.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of HEAPSORT on the array A = 5, 13, 2, 25, 7, 17, 20, 8, 4.

### `Solution:`
BUILD_MAX_HEAP(A): 
        
        A = 25, 13, 20, 8, 7, 17, 2, 5, 4

        A = 20, 13, 17, 8, 7, 4, 2, 5, | 25

        A = 17, 13, 5, 8, 7, 4, 2, | 20, 25

        A = 13, 8, 5, 2, 7, 4, | 17, 20, 25

        A = 8, 7, 5, 2, 4, | 13, 17, 20, 25

        A = 7, 4, 5, 2, | 8, 13, 17, 20, 25

        A = 5, 4, 2, | 7, 8, 13, 17, 20, 25

        A = 4, 2, | 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 20, 25

        A = 2, | 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 20, 25

### 6.4-2
***
Argue the correctness of HEAPSORT using the following loop invariant:
* At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2–5, the subarray A[1 ... i] is a max-heap containing the i smallest
elements of A[1 ... n], and the subarray A[i + 1 ... n] contains the n - i largest elements of A[1 ... n], sorted.

### `Solution:`
In each iteration we move the largest element to the sorted array.

### 6.4-3
***
What is the running time of HEAPSORT on an array A of length n that is already sorted in increasing order? What about decreasing 
order?

### `Solution:`
Both are Θ(nlgn) since there are n calls to MAX-HEAPIFY.

### 6.4-4
***
Show that the worst-case running time of HEAPSORT is $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$.

### `Solution:`
BUILD-HEAD is Θ(n) and MAX-HEAPIFY is Θ(nlgn).

### *6.4-5
***
Show that when all elements are distinct, the best-case running time of HEAPSORT is $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$.
