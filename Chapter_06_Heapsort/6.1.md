## 6.1 Heaps

### 6.1-1
***
What are the minimum and maximum numbers of elements in a heap of height $$h$$?

### `Solution:`
Minimum: 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{h-1} + 1 = 2^h

Maximum: 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^h = 2^{h+1} - 1

### 6.1-2
***
Show that an n-element heap has height $$\left \lfloor \lg n \right \rfloor$$.

### `Solution:`
As we can see from 6.1-1, a heap of height $$h$$ has 2^h elements at least and 2^{h+1} - 1 elements at most. 
So an n-element heap has height $$\left \lfloor \lg n \right \rfloor$$.

### 6.1-3
***
Show that in any subtree of a max-heap, the root of the subtree contains the largest value occurring anywhere in that subtree.

### `Solution:`
Transitivity of A[i] >= A[LEFT(i)] and A[i] >= A[RIGHT(i)].

### 6.1-4
***
Where in a max-heap might the smallest element reside, assuming that all elements are distinct?

### `Solution:`
The leaves.

### 6.1-5
***
Is an array that is in sorted order a min-heap?

### `Solution:`
Yes, since A[PARENT(i)] < A[i] for all i.

### 6.1-6
***
Is the array with values $$\left \langle 23, 17, 14, 6, 13, 10, 1, 5, 7, 12 \right \rangle$$ a max-heap?

### `Solution:`
No, since 6 < 7.

### 6.1-7
***
Show that, with the array representation for storing an $$n$$-element heap, the leaves are the nodes indexed by $$\left \lfloor n/2 \right \rfloor + 1, \left \lfloor n/2 \right \rfloor + 2, \dots, n$$.

### `Solution:`
Beacuse the parent of the last node n is $$\left \lfloor n/2 \right \rfloor$$. So after PARENT[n], each node is a leaf.
