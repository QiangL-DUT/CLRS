## 6.5 Priority queues

### 6.5-1
***
Illustrate the operation of HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX on the heap A = 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1.

### `Solution:`
Return 15 and A = 13, 12, 9, 5, 6, 8, 7, 4, 0, 1, 2.

### 6.5-2
***
Illustrate the operation of MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A, 10) on the heap A = 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1.

### `Solution:`
Insert: A = 15, 13, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, -∞

Increase: A = 15, 13, 10, 5, 12, 9, 7, 4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 8

### 6.5-3
***
Write pseudocode for the procedures HEAP-MINIMUM, HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN, HEAP-DECREASE-KEY, and MIN-HEAP-INSERT that implement a 
min-priority queue with a min-heap.

### 'Solution:'
        HEAP-MINIMUM(A)
                return A[1]
        
        HEAP-EXTRACT-MIN(A)
                if A.heap-size < 1
                        error "heap underflow"
                min = A[1]
                A[1] = A[A.heap-size]
                A.heap-size = A.heap-size - 1
                MIN-HEAPIFY(A, 1)
                return min
        
        HEAP-DECREASE-KEY(A, i, key)
                if key > A[i]
                        error "new key is larger than current key"
                A[i] = key
                while i > 1 and A[PARENT(i)] > A[i]
                        swap A[i] and A[PARENT(i)]
                        i = PARENT(i)
        
        MIN-HEAP-INSERT
                A.heap-size = A.heap-size + 1
                A[A.heap-size] = +∞
                HEAP-DECREASE-KEY(A, A.heap-size, key)
* [6.5-3.cpp](./exercise_code/6.5-3.cpp)
                 
### 6.5-4

> Why do we bother setting the key of the inserted node to $$-\infty$$ in line 2 of MAXHEAP-INSERT when the next thing we do is increase its key to the desired value?

To make $$key \ge A[i]$$.

### 6.5-5

> Argue the correctness of HEAP-INCREASE-KEY using the following loop invariant:

>> At the start of each iteration of the while loop of lines 4–6, the subarray $$A[1 \dots A.heap\text{-}size]$$ satisfies the max-heap property, except that there may be one violation: $$A[i]$$ may be larger than $$A[\text{PARENT}(i)]$$.

> You may assume that the subarray $$A[1 \dots A.heap\text{-}size]$$ satisfies the max-heap property at the time HEAP-INCREASE-KEY is called.

Correct.

### 6.5-6

> Each exchange operation on line 5 of HEAP-INCREASE-KEY typically requires three assignments. Show how to use the idea of the inner loop of INSERTION-SORT to reduce the three assignments down to just one assignment.

```python
def heap_increase_key(a, i, key):
    assert(key >= a[i])
    while i > 0 and key > a[parent(i)]:
        a[i] = a[parent(i)]
        i = parent(i)
    a[i] = key
```

### 6.5-7

> Show how to implement a first-in, first-out queue with a priority queue. Show how to implement a stack with a priority queue.

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []
        self.inc = 0

    def push(self, val):
        self.inc += 1
        min_heap_insert(self.heap, (self.inc, val))

    def front(self):
        return heap_minimum(self.heap)

    def pop(self):
        return heap_extract_min(self.heap)


class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []
        self.inc = 0

    def push(self, val):
        self.inc += 1
        max_heap_insert(self.heap, (self.inc, val))

    def top(self):
        return heap_maximum(self.heap)

    def pop(self):
        return heap_extract_max(self.heap)
```

### 6.5-8

> The operation HEAP-DELETE$$(A, i)$$ deletes the item in node $$i$$ from heap $$A$$. Give an implementation of HEAP-DELETE that runs in $$O(\lg n)$$ time for an n-element max-heap.

```python
def heap_delete(a, i):
    if i == len(a) - 1:
        del a[-1]
    else:
        a[i] = a[-1]
        del a[-1]
        max_heapify(a, i)
        heap_increase_key(a, i, a[i])
```

### 6.5-9

> Give an $$O(n \lg k)$$-time algorithm to merge $$k$$ sorted lists into one sorted list, where $$n$$ is the total number of elements in all the input lists. (Hint: Use a minheap for $$k$$-way merging.)

```python
def merge_lists(lists):
    k = len(lists)
    heap = []
    for i in range(k):
        if len(lists[i]) > 0:
            min_heap_insert(heap, (lists[i][0], i))
    idx = [0 for lst in lists]
    a = []
    while len(heap) > 0:
        val, i = heap_extract_min(heap)
        a.append(val)
        idx[i] += 1
        if idx[i] < len(lists[i]):
            min_heap_insert(heap, (lists[i][idx[i]], i))
    return a
```
