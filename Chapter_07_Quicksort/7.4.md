## 7.4 Analysis of quicksort

### 7.4-1
***
Show that in the recurrence 

$$\displaystyle T(n) = \max_{0 \le q \le n-1}(T(q)+T(n-q-1)) + \Theta(n)$$,

$$T(n) = \Omega(n^2)$$.

### 7.4-2
***
Show that quicksort’s best-case running time is $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$.

### 7.4-3
***
Show that the expression q^2 + (n-q-1)^2 achieves a maximum over q = 0,1, ..., n-1 when q = 0 or q = n-1.

### 7.4-4
***
Show that RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT’s expected running time is $$\Omega(n \lg n)$$.

### 7.4-5

We can improve the running time of quicksort in practice by taking advantage of the fast running time of insertion sort when 
its input is "nearly" sorted. Upon calling quicksort on a subarray with fewer than k elements, let it simply return without 
sorting the subarray. After the top-level call to quicksort returns, run insertion sort on the entire array to finish the sorting 
process. Argue that this sorting algorithm runs in $$O(nk + n \lg(n/k))$$ expected time. How should we pick k, both in theory 
and in practice?

### `Solution:`
QUICK-SORT: layer number is $$O(\lg (n/k))$$, therefore it is $$O(n \lg (n/k))$$.

INSERTION-SORT: each subarray is $$O(k^2)$$, the number of subarrays is $$O(n/k)$$, therefore it is $$O(nk)$$.

Therefore this sorting algorithm runs in $$O(nk + n \lg(n/k))$$.

In practice we should use profiling.

### *7.4-6

Consider modifying the PARTITION procedure by randomly picking three elements from array A and partitioning about their median 
(the middle value of the three elements). Approximate the probability of getting at worst an $$\alpha$$-to-$$(1-\alpha)$$ split, 
as a function of $$\alpha$$ in the range $$0 < \alpha < 1$$.
