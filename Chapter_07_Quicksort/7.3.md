## 7.3 A randomized version of quicksort

### 7.3-1
***
Why do we analyze the expected running time of a randomized algorithm and not its worst-case running time?

### `Solution:`
Even with the same input, the running time will be different.

### 7.3-2
***
When RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT runs, how many calls are made to the random-number generator RANDOM in the worst case? How about 
in the best case? Give your answer in terms of Θ-notation.

### `Solution:`
Worst: 
T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(1) = Θ(n)

Best: 
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(1) = Θ(n)
