## 7.1 Description of quicksort

### 7.1-1
***
Using Figure 7.1 as a model, illustrate the operation of PARTITION on the array A = 13, 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11.

### `Solution:`
        A = | 13, 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = | 13, | 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = | 13, 19, | 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, | 19, 13, | 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, | 13, 19, | 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, | 13, 19, 12,|  8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, 8, | 19, 12, 13, | 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, 8, 7, | 12, 13, 19, | 4, 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, 8, 7, 4, | 13, 19, 12, | 21, 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, 8, 7, 4, | 13, 19, 12, 21, | 2, 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, 8, 7, 4, 2, | 19, 12, 21, 13, | 6, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, 8, 7, 4, 2, 6, | 12, 21, 13, 19, | 11
        
        A = 9, 5, 8, 7, 4, 2, 6, | 11, | 21, 13, 19, 12

### 7.1-2
***
What value of q does PARTITION return when all elements in the array A[p ... r] have the same value? Modify PARTITION so
that q = (p + r)/2 when all elements in the array A[p ... r] have the same value.

### `Solution:`
PARTITION returns r.
        PARTITION(A, p, r)
                x = A[r]        
                i = p - 1
                for j = p to r - 1
                        if A[j] < x
                                swap(A[++i], A[j])
                k = i
                for j = i + 1 to r - 1
                        if A[j] == x
                                swap(A[++k], A[j])
                swap(A[++k], A[r])
                return (i + k + 1) / 2

### 7.1-3
***
Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size n is Î˜(n).

### `Solution:`
Only one loop.

### 7.1-4
***
How would you modify QUICKSORT to sort into nonincreasing order?

### `Solution:`
        QUICKSORT(A, p, r)
                if p < r
                q = PARTITION(A, p, r)
                QUICKSORT(A, p, q - 1)
                QUICKSORT(A, q + 1, r)

        PARTITION(A, p, r)
                x = A[r]
                i = p - 1
                for j = p to r - 1
                        if A[j] >= x
                                i = i + 1
                                swap(A[i], A[j])
                swap(A[i], A[j])
                return i + 1
