## 15.5 Optimal binary search trees

### 15.5-1
***
Write pseudocode for the procedure CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST(root) which, given the table root, outputs the structure of an optimal 
binary search tree. For the example in Figure 15.10, your procedure should print out the structure corresponding to the optimal 
binary search tree shown in Figure 15.9(b).

### `Solution:`
    CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST(root, i, j)
        if i < j
            return
        if i == 1 and j == n
            print root[i][j] " is the root"
        if i == j
            print d_{i-1} " is the left child of " k_i
            print d_[i] " is the right child of " k_i
        else
            mid = root[i][j]
            left = root[i][mid-1]
            right = root[mid+1][j]
            if mid == i
                print d_{i-1} " is the left child of " k_{mid}
                print k_{right} " is the right child of " k_{mid}
                CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST(root, mid+1, j)
            elseif mid == j
                print k_{left} " is the left child of " k_{mid}
                CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST(root, i, mid-1)
                print d_{right} " is the right child of " k_{mid}
            else
                print k_{left} " is the left child of " k_{mid}
                CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST(root, i, mid-1)
                print k_{right} " is the right child of " k_{mid}
                CONSTRUCT-OPTIMAL-BST(root, mid+1, j)

### 15.5-2
***
Determine the cost and structure of an optimal binary search tree for a set of n = 7 keys with the following probabilities

### 15.5-3
***
Suppose that instead of maintaining the table w[i, j], we computed the value of w(i, j) directly from equation (15.12) in line 9 
of OPTIMAL-BST and used this computed value in line 11. How would this change affect the asymptotic running time of OPTIMAL-BST?

### `Solution:`
O(n^3)

### *15.5-4
***
Knuth [212] has shown that there are always roots of optimal subtrees such that root[i, j - 1] <= root[i, j] <= root[i + 1, j] for 
all 1 <= i < j <= n. Use this fact to modify the OPTIMAL-BST procedure to run in O(n^2) time.
