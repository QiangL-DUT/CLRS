## 15.2 Matrix-chain multiplication

### 15.2-1
***
Find an optimal parenthesization of a matrix-chain product whose sequence of dimensions is <5, 10, 3, 12, 5, 50, 6>.

### 15.2-2
***
Give a recursive algorithm MATRIX-CHAIN-MULTIPLY(A, s, i, j) that actually performs the optimal matrix-chain multiplication, given the 
sequence of matrices <A_1, A_2, ... ,A_{n_i}>, the s table computed by MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER, and the indices i and j. (The initial call 
would be MATRIX-CHAIN-MULTIPLY(A, s, 1, n).)

### `Solution:`
    MATRIX-CHAIN-MULTIPLY(A, s, i, j)
        if i == j
            return A[i]
        if i + 1 == j
            return A[i] * A[j]
        b = MATRIX-CHAIN-MULTIPLY(A, s, i, s[i, j])
        c = MATRIX-CHAIN-MULTIPLY(A, s, s[i, j] + 1, j)
        return b * c

### 15.2-3
***
Use the substitution method to show that the solution to the recurrence (15.6) is Omega(2^n).

### 15.2-4
***
Describe the subproblem graph for matrix-chain multiplication with an input chain of length n. How many vertices does it have? How 
many edges does it have, and which edges are they?

### `Solution:`
Vertice: O(n^2), Edges: O(n^3).

### 15.2-5
***
Let R(i, j) be the number of times that table entry m[i, j] is referenced while computing other table entries in a call of 
MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER. Show that the total number of references for the entire table is

sum_{i=1}^n sum_{j=i}^n R(i, j) = (n^3-n)/3.

### 15.2-6
***
Show that a full parenthesization of an n-element expression has exactly n-1 pairs of parentheses.

### `Solution:`
n - 1 multiplications.
