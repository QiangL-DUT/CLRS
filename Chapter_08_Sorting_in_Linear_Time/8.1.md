## 8.1 Lower bounds for sorting

### 8.1-1
***
What is the smallest possible depth of a leaf in a decision tree for a comparison sort?

### `Solution:`
It's Θ(n), or more precisely, n−1. This is the minimal number of comparisons we need to perform in order to check if an array is 
sorted and return it. It's what insertion sort does.

### 8.1-2
***
Obtain asymptotically tight bounds on lg(n!) without using Stirling’s approximation. Instead, evaluate the summation sum_{k=1}^n lgk 
using techniques from Section A.2.

### 8.1-3
***
Show that there is no comparison sort whose running time is linear for at least half of the n! inputs of length n. What about a 
fraction of 1/n of the inputs of length n? What about a fraction 1/2^n?

### 8.1-4
***
Suppose that you are given a sequence of n elements to sort. The input sequence consists of n/k subsequences, each containing k 
elements. The elements in a given subsequence are all smaller than the elements in the succeeding subsequence and larger than the 
elements in the preceding subsequence. Thus, all that is needed to sort the whole sequence of length n is to sort the k elements 
in each of the n/k subsequences. Show an $$\Omega(n\lg k)$$ lower bound on the number of comparisons needed to solve this variant 
of the sorting problem.
