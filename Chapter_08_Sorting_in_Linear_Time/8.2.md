## 8.2 Counting sort

### 8.2-1
***
Using Figure 8.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of COUNTING-SORT on the array A = 6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2.

### `Solution:`
    A = 6, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2
    
    C = 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2
    
    C = 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 9, 11
    
    B = 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6

### 8.2-2
***
Prove that COUNTING-SORT is stable.

### `Solution:`
Value with larger index choose the largest index first.

### 8.2-3
***
Suppose that we were to rewrite the for loop header in line 10 of the COUNTING-SORT as
```
10 for j = 1 to A.length
```
Show that the algorithm still works properly. Is the modified algorithm stable?

### `Solution:`
Works properly but not stable.

### 8.2-4
***
Describe an algorithm that, given n integers in the range 0 to k, preprocesses its input and then answers any query about how
many of the n integers fall into a range [a ... b] in O(1) time. Your algorithm should use Î˜(n + k) preprocessing time.

### `Solution:`
Use `C` in the counting sort, the number of integers fall into a range [a ... b]$$ is C[b] - C[a-1].
    
    COUNTINTERVAL
        INIT(A, k)
            let C[-1,...,k] be a new array
            for i = -1 to k
                C[i] = 0
            for i = 1 to A.length
                C[A[i]] = C[A[i]] + 1
            for i = 1 to k
                C[i] = C[i] + C[i-1]
                
        COUNT(A, a, b)
            return C[b] - C[a-1]
