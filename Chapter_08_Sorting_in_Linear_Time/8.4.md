## 8.4 Bucket sort

### 8.4-1
***
Using Figure 8.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of BUCKET-SORT on the array A = .79, .13, .16, .64, .39, .20, .89, .53, .71, .42.

| R | |
|:-:|:--|
| 0 ||
| 1 |.13 .16|
| 2 |.20|
| 3 |.39|
| 4 |.42|
| 5 |.53|
| 6 |.64|
| 7 ||
| 8 |.79 .71|
| 9 |.89|

A = .13, .16, .20, .39, .42, .53, .64, .71, .79, .89

### 8.4-2

Explain why the worst-case running time for bucket sort is Θ(n^2). What simple change to the algorithm preserves its linear average-case running time and makes its worst-case running time O(nlgn)?

### `Solution:`
Worst: all the elements falls in one bucket, Θ(n^2) sorting.

Change: use merge sort in each bucket.

Let X be a random variable that is equal to the number of heads in two flips of a fair coin. What is E[X^2]? What is E^2[X]?

### `Solution:`
E[X] = 2 * 1/4 + 1 * 1/2 + 0 * 1/4 = 1

E[X^2] = 4 * 1/4 + 1 * 1/2 + 0 * 1/4 = 1.5

E^2[X] = E[X] * E[X] = 1 * 1 = 1

### *8.4-4

We are given n points in the unit circle, p_i = (xi, yi), such that 0 < x_i^2 + y_i^2 <= 1 for i = 1,2, ... ,n. Suppose that the 
points are uniformly distributed; that is, the probability of finding a point in any region of the circle is proportional to the area 
of that region. Design an algorithm with an average-case running time of Θ(n) to sort the n points by their distances d_i = 
\sqrt{x_i^2+y_i^2} from the origin. 

### `Solution:`
Bucket sort by radius, 

pi * r_i^2 = i/10 * pi * 1^2

r_i = sqrt(i/10)

### *8.4-5
***
A __*probability distribution function*__ P(x) for a random variable X is defined by P(x) = Pr{X <= x}. Suppose that we draw a list of
n random variables X_1,X_2, ... ,X_n from a continuous probability distribution function P that is computable in O(1) time. Give an 
algorithm that sorts these numbers in linear average-case time.
