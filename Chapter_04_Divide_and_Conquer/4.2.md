### 4.2-3
***
How would you modify Strassen’s algorithm to multiply n * n matrices in which n is not an exact power of 2? Show that the resulting algorithm runs in time Θ(n^{lg7}).

### `Solution:`
Extend the matrix with zeros.

### 4.2-4
***
What is the largest k such that if you can multiply 3 * 3 matrices using k multiplications (not assuming commutativity of multiplication), then you can multiply n * n matrices in time Θ(n^{lg7})? What would the running time of this algorithm be?

### `Solution:`
T(n) = kT(n/3) + O(n^2)

Running time: Θ(n^{log_3 7})

k < 3^{lg 7} ~ 21.84986222490514

### 4.2-5

> V. Pan has discovered a way of multiplying $$68 \times 68$$ matrices using $$132,464$$ multiplications, a way of multiplying $$70 \times 70$$ matrices using $$143,640$$ multiplications, and a way of multiplying $$72 \times 72$$ matrices using $$155,424$$ multiplications. Which method yields the best asymptotic  matrix-multiplication algorithm? How does it compare to Strassen’s algorithm?

$$T_1 = \Theta(n^{\log_{68}132464}) = \Theta(n^{2.7951284873613815})$$

$$T_2 = \Theta(n^{\log_{70}143640}) = \Theta(n^{2.795122689748337})$$

$$T_3 = \Theta(n^{\log_{72}155424}) = \Theta(n^{2.795147391093449})$$

$$T_2 < T_1 < T_3 < \Theta(n^{\lg 7})$$

> How quickly can you multiply a $$kn \times n$$ matrix by an $$n \times kn$$ matrix, using Strassen’s algorithm as a subroutine? Answer the same question with the order of the input matrices reversed.

$$\Theta(k^2n^{\lg 7})$$

Reversed: $$\Theta(kn^{\lg 7})$$


### 4.2-7

> Show how to multiply the complex numbers $$a + bi$$ and $$c + di$$ using only three multiplications of real numbers. The algorithm should take $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, and $$d$$ as input and produce the real component $$ac - bd$$ and the imaginary component $$ad + bc$$ separately.

$$P_1 = a \cdot (c - d)$$

$$P_2 = b \cdot (c + d)$$

$$P_3 = d \cdot (a - b)$$

Real component: $$P_1 + P_3$$

Image component: $$P_2 + P_3$$
